Data Analysis with Python Internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies ðŸš€


Introduction: 
Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey as a Data Analysis with Python intern at Main Flow Services and Technologies! In this repository, I'll be sharing my learnings, projects, and experiences throughout the internship.


Internship Highlights: 
Learning Python and Data Analysis: Sharpening my Python analyze data efficiently and derive valuable insights.
Hands-on Projects: Working on real-world projects to apply theoretical knowledge and gain practical experience.
Collaborative Environment: Engaging with a talented team of professionals and learning from their expertise.

Task 1: Understanding Basic Data Structures

Description: This task involves understanding the basic data types in Python such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Responsibility: Wrote a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set, that can perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.

Task 2: Data Manipulation with Pandas

Description: This task involves using the Pandas library to manipulate data.

Responsibility: Loaded a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and performed operations like filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values, and calculating summary statistics.

Task 3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Description: This task involves using the matplotlib library to visualize data.
